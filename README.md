Payflow is a simple app to manage your bills

The app has an emmbed barcode reader made using Google ML Kit

Some features are missing, as I haven't changed anything after the tutorial.

**For the app to work you have to add your own google-services.json**

find out how to do it **[here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)**

**Since the app uses the Google login feature, you must have an SHA-1 certificate when adding the application to Firebase**
